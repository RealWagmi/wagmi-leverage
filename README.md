### repay

This function is used to repay a loan.The position is closed either by the trader or by the liquidator if the trader has not paid for holding the position and the moment of liquidation has arrived.The positions borrowed from liquidation providers are restored from the held token and the remainder is sent to the caller.In the event of liquidation, the liquidity provider whose liquidity is present in the traderâ€™s position can use the emergency mode and withdraw their liquidity.In this case, he will receive hold tokens and liquidity will not be restored in the uniswap pool.
